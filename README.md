## Small dockerized API for generating random words
I needed a small, simple API that would return random words based on given criteria - either by length or pattern. This repository contains such an application that uses FastAPI and SQLite.

### Dictonary source
[https://github.com/dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

If you want to change it, put your raw dictionary in `src/data/source.txt` (one word per line) and refill the db by running `fill.py`.

### Quickstart
Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/kwisek/small-random-word-api.git`

Build the container with `docker build -t <name> .`

Start the container with `docker run -d -p <ports> <name>`

### API
[]()  | []() | []() | []()
